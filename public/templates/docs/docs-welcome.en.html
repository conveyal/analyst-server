     <p>
     OTPA requires two pieces of information to complete and run an accessibility model, these are spatial data and transport information.  Spatial data is added to the model in the form of Shapefiles which contain fields of information that will be included in the analysis, the shapefile is then converted by OTPA into a point set to allow the information contained within it to be specific to a given point and included in the analysis.  Transport information is imported in the form of a zipped folder containing General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) files.
     </p>

     <p>
     These two types of data are then added to the map data already included in the form of OpenStreetMap (OSM) to produce map and table based results which can be interrogated within OTPA or exported to be used in other software.  Analysis can be run as a single-point calculation where all the results are based around a chosen origin/destination, or as an area-wide calculation that looks at all possible journeys within the study area.</p>
